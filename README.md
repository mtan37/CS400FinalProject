# CS400FinalProject

To clone the git repository:
1) Open command line
2) cd to your eclipse workspace (not the project folder)
3) git clone https://github.com/Dorbeeee/CS400FinalProject
4) cd CS400FinalProject
5) git clone https://github.com/Dorbeeee/CS400FinalProject.git  (This is needed because it's not cloned in step 3. We need .git folder to use git commands)

Now you have the project in the eclipse workspace. When you want to add changes:
1) git add .
2) git commit -m "Whatever change messages"
3) git push

If there is change by other people use:
1) git pull
